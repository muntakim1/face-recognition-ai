Welcome to Face-Recognition-AI, an advanced face recognition system built with cutting-edge technologies, including FaceNet and YOLO5Face. This project draws inspiration from the popular face-recognition module, aiming to provide users with a professional and efficient solution for face recognition.

# üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Face-Recognition-AI, follow these simple steps:
`pip install face-recognition-ai`

# üí° Features

- FaceNet Integration: Leveraging the power of FaceNet, our system directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space, enabling accurate and efficient face recognition [5].

- YOLO5Face Detection: The YOLO5Face model enhances face detection capabilities, ensuring robust identification of faces in various scenarios.

- Inspired by Face-Recognition Module: We take inspiration from the widely-used face-recognition module, incorporating best practices and user-friendly design.
