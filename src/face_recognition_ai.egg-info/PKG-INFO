Welcome to Face-Recognition-AI, an advanced face recognition system built with cutting-edge technologies, including FaceNet and YOLO5Face. This project draws inspiration from the popular face-recognition module, aiming to provide users with a professional and efficient solution for face recognition.

# üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Face-Recognition-AI, follow these simple steps:

`pip install face-recognition-ai`

Run python usage.py

```
from PIL import Image

from face_recognition_ai import match_faces, show_detections

unknown_with_multiple_faces = Image.open("images/multi.jpeg")

known = Image.open("images/sakib.jpg")
known_person_name = "sakib"

print(True if True in match_faces(unknown_with_multiple_faces, known) else False)
img = show_detections(unknown_with_multiple_faces, known, known_person_name)
img.show()



```

# üí° Features

- FaceNet Integration: Leveraging the power of FaceNet, our system directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space, enabling accurate and efficient face recognition [5].

- YOLO5Face Detection: The YOLO5Face model enhances face detection capabilities, ensuring robust identification of faces in various scenarios.

- Inspired by Face-Recognition Module: We take inspiration from the widely-used face-recognition module, incorporating best practices and user-friendly design.
